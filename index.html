                Cats are the best! My husband and I have two cats: Chester and Zoe. They were both adopted from the Hawaiian Humane Society in Honolulu. Chester is a gray tabby, and Zoe is a calico. They each have their own sweet personality, and we love them both dearly!

                Stickers are the best! I love using stickers to organize my monthly and weekly planner. In my mind, my interests in organization and productivity as well as design thrive when I can use colorful, functional stickers to plan out my week. In a way, these same interests are why I'm enjoying learning to code websites! The organization of the code and the design of the finished product are both critical to creating beautiful websites!

                Food is the best! My husband and I both love food, and when we travel we always enjoy the regional food. We've traveled to many countries together over the past 5 1/2 years. In Venice and in Dublin, we even went on food tours to experience the local flavors and learn a bit about the culinary traditions of those places. Now that we live in Minnesota instead of Hawaii, we've learned to make our own delicious Hawaiian style foods as well-- shoyu chicken, chicken long rice, kalua pork and cabbage, and even Liliha Bakery banana bread cupcakes with macadamia nut chantilly frosting!
